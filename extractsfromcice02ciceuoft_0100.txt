196 N o T E s. Sect. ιν.

351. In pictis—formis, ¹ in painting,statuary‚andchased work.' ‘Fingo'
with its derivatives is properly applied to figures moulded in soft material, as
wax or clay, but is extended as a general term to all kinds of statuary‚ as
even figures cut out in stone are first modelled in clay or wax. ‘ Caelatura ⁹
was used for all kinds of ornamental metal work, but especially for what was
wrought in relief.

355. Iratum propitium, the pairs of adjectives here are contrasted:
‘ they can distinguish an angry from a friendly man‚’ δίο. We should prefer
in English the abstract substantives‚ ‘ anger from friendliness‚' &c.

-358, In vocis-cantibus, ‘ both in vocal music and in that of pipes or
stringed instruments.'

360. Candidum fuscum, ‘ the clear from the husky.’ These are used
by Quintilian as techiiical terms of rhetoric.

361. Grave acutum, ‘bass from treble?

Durum would be expressed by our word ‘ wooden.’

362. Et gustandi et tangendi, ‘the senses of taste and touch!

366. Qo processerint, ‘ to what a pitch have run.’

Corporum lenocinia, ‘ways of embellishing the person.’ See Dict.
of Ant. v. Unguenta.

368. Animum ipsum mentemque, of these two words ‘animus' is
the wider, embracing properly the whole rational principle in man, as ‘ anima'
does the principle of animal life, while ‘ mens' denotes specially the intellec-
tual faculties. When they are joined together ‘ animus ’ refers rather to the
will and the emotional part of the mind. ‘ Consilium ’ is the power of com-
bination by which he forms plans, ‘ prudentiam' his power of foresight by
which he foresees the consequences and results of actions.

369. Perfecta. Observe that an adjective or participle agreeing with a.
number of substantives of different genders‚ if they denote inanimate things,
is always itself neuter. The rule that the masculine is preferred to the
feminine is confined to things animate.

371. Consequentium—comprehensio, ‘how great a power ofcorn-
bining and grasping together consequences with their antecedents.'

374. Singulas res, ‘ separate objects.'

Circumscripte complectimur, ‘ comprise in a few words.’

377. Ea quae extra sunt, ⁶ external objects?

378. Collatis et comparatis. Observe al] through this passage the
numerous instances of Cicero's fondness for using two synonymous or nearly
synonymous words where one would suffice. It is often better in English to
drop one of them.

379. Ad usum vitae necessarias, ⁸ required for the necessities of
life)

380. Domina rerum, ‘that queen of the world.’ Cp. Virg. G. 2. 534'

And Ae. 1. 282

‘Romanos rerum dominos-⁹
