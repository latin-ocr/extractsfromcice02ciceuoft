σὴψ. 11. OMENS ΛΝΒ DREA MS. 145

222. Sed id—contemnere, 'despising the tokens which the gods send
is in reality not believing in them.'

224. Tuae partes sunt, ‘ that is your duty.' This is addressed to
Cicero, who was one of the college of augurs, by his brother Qintus.

226. Addubitato‚ ⁶ called in question.'

Salutis augurio. Salus was the goddess who personified ‘health and
wealth‚’ either of individuals or of the commonwealth. In the latter capacity

by which the augurs at the beginning of the consular year observed the
signs to ascertain the fortune of the commonwealth for the coming year.

230. Non decantandi—disciplinam, ‘ maintained the established
method not merely of repeating off lhe form of augury, but of really

The lines are interesting as a specimen of his attempts at poetry, of which
he was very vain.

244. Ahisoni, ⁸ who thunders from on high?

syllable of this word, which is properly short.

birds made the omen favourable or the contrary.

252. Praepetibus pennis. Cp. Virg. A'e. 6. 15

‘Praepetibus pennis ausus se credere caelo!
⁸ Praepes' is also applied to birds who give omen by their flight; so it is used
