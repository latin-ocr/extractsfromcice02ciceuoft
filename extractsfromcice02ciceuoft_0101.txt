Sect. lv. ΒΕΑ UTIES OF NATURE. 197

382. Efficit ut possimus, ‘enables us to,’ &c.

385. Gestientes comprimimus, ‘ we calm excitement.'

387. Iuris, legum, ‘law and enactments.' ‘Ius’ is the more general
word, and comprehends all that is included under the word ‘law’ in its
widest sense; ‘ lex’ always refers to a specific enactment. (From Smith's
Dict.)

388. Immani et fera, “uncivilized and savage.'

390. Arteria, ‘ the wind—pipe‚' called above l. 259, ⁸ aspera arteria.'

39²· Percipitur et funditur, ‘is received (i.e. from the mind) and
uttered.'

Finita dentibus ς cp. the well-known expression of Homer ’ἕρκος
ὀδόντων.

393. Fingit et terminat, ‘it reduces to shape and controls.’

394. Pressos, ‘ accurate‚' ‘plain.’ lt is more usually applied to style of
speech, and then means ‘ compressed,’ ‘ concise.'

395. Similem. Observe the change of case with ‘ similis.’ ‘Plectri'
and ⁶ chordarum ' are in the genitive, because their resemblance to the tongue
and the teeth is in use, an inward likeness, ⁴ cornibus' is in the dative, be-
cause the resemblance between them and the nostrils is one of external
appearance.

396. Cornibus iis. See above on 1. 342³ in cantibus, ‘in
music!

401 Nullo in motu laborat, ‘ can perform any movement without
difficulty.'

Ad pingendum, διο. The three words correspond to the ‘ pictae, fictae,
et caelatae formae ’ mentioned above, l. 351.

404. Illa, literally, ‘those other‚' as contrasted with those which have
been just mentioned (haec), in English, ‘ the following.’

406. Ad inventa—manibus, ‘when we add the hands of craftsmen to
what the mind has invented and the senses discovered!

408. Possemus, haberemus. Imperfects again referring, not to the
completed action of ‘consecutos,' but to that end as aimed at from the
beginning. See notes on ll. 120 and 323.

411. Manu quaesita, ‘produced by cultivation.¹

413. Bestiis—volatilibus, ⁶ birds, beasts, and fishes.' Partim ca-
piendo, partim alendo, ‘ some ofwhich we catch, others we rear.’

414. Efficimus domitu nostro quadrupedum vectiones, ‘we
tame animals and make them carry us.'

419. Abutimur, ‘ make full use of.'

422. Materia, ‘ timber!

424. Ad mitigandum cibum, ⁸ for cooking food.'

428. Moderationem habemus, ‘have the control of.’ Observe that
‘ res ' is expressed with the relative, not with the demonstrative ‘ earum' as
an antecedent.
