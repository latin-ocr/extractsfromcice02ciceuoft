and its compounds are rarely used, and when they do occur, the participle is
usually, as would naturally be the case, a genuine passive.
471. Ea, accusative after ‘ gignere,' referring to ⁶ frugibus et vario legumi-

m n e.’
unffi? lilerci piendi, ⁸ gathering in,' ⁸ harvesting.’ This is the literal sense

of the word. from which it derives its other meaning, whence we get our
word ⁴ perceive‚’ by metaphor‚ acquiring knowledge being, in a way, a reap-
ing of a mental harvest.

475. Reponendi, ‘storing up.' Cp. Virg. Ae. 4. 402

‘Ac veluti ingentem formicae farris acervum
Qum populant, hiemis memores, tectoque reponunt.'

And so Horace, Epod. 9. Ι, speaks of the wine in his cellar as ‘repostum
Caecubum ad festas dapes.’ The gerunds in this sentence are genitives ofthe
object, ‘pecudum' is genitive of the subject. So in the following sentence
‘earum omnium rerum’ is objective, ‘hominum' subjective.

486. Nisi forte. The sentence in the parenthesis is to be regarded as
ironical.

Pomorum, ‘ fruits‚’ a generic term. See above, note on l. 3.

492. Confectis, ⁸ prepared,¹ ‘ manufactured.’

493. Qae quidem—potuissent, ‘nay, they could not even have

been reared‚' &e.
496. Adulatio. This is the literal meaning of the word, ¹ adulor’ is

properly applied to a dog, fawning upon its master by wagging its tail. It
is probably derived from the same root as Gr. οὐρά, the tail, l being often

substituted for r.

502. Extrahenda; if the reading is correct, this word is used in the
sense of the simple ‘trahenda :’ but there is no other instance of its being
so used. The force of the preposition is generally very emphatic wherever

it is used.
Qibus is dative after ‘afferebatur,' and is not to be connected with

⁸ subigerentur,’ though no doubt it suggests ‘ab iis' to express the agent of
the latter verb.

Qum terrae subigerentur, ‘when the earth was first being broken
up :' this must be the meaning, as oxen were still used for ploughing. He
is contradicting the common tradition about the golden age, in which, ac-
cording to the poets, the earth produced crops without any tillage. Cp.
Virg. G. 1. 125

‘Ante Iovem nulli subigebant arva coloni.
. . . ipsaque tellus
Omnia liberiuS‚ nullo poscente, ferebat.’
‘Subigere' (see note on Pt. 1. Sect. 1. 5, 9) is a regular agricultural term
and not a poetical metaphor. Conington (note on Virg. G. 2. 50) quotes
from Columella, a writer on agriculture, ⁴ Locum subigere oportet bene; ubi
erit subactus areas facito?

503. Vis nulla afferebatur. There is a passage quoted in Davies' note
