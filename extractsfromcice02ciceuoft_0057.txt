Chap. vl. OMENS ΛΝΒ DREAMS. 153

Annalists, their histories being called ‘Annales.' L. Caelius Antipater was
another of the same class ofwriters. He was contemporary with Gellius, The
story is also told by Livy, 2. 36.

Bello Latino. This did not occur in the great Latin War, but, according
to Livy, during the war with the Volscians, in which Coriolanus com-

manded.
115. Ludi maximi. More commonly called ‘Magni’ or ‘Circenses'

They were said to have been instituted by Romulus, aud consisted of taces
and other amusements in the Circus. See Dict. of Ant. ‘ Circus.'

116. Primum does not mean that this was the first occasion on which
they were ever performed, but that this was the first time of their perform-
ince that year, as opposed to the repetition of thern related below.

117. Instaurativi; supply ‘ludi.' ‘ The games were coinmenced over
again.'

119. Furcam, literally, ‘ a fork ε’ here an instrument of punishment in
use among the Romans for slaves. It was an instrument of wood‚ in the
shape of a Greek A, which was placed over the shoulders of the victim‚ and
his hands tied to it: hence came the word ¹ furcifer ’ as a term of reproach.
Sometimes it was used to tie criminals to, who were then scomged, some-
times to death. So Livy, 2. 36, describes it as being used in this case, ‘ ser-
vum quidam paterfamiliae, nondum commisso spectaculo, sub furca caesum
medio egerat circo? The ‘ triangles’ used in military floggings in our own
army are somewhat similar.

120. Visus est venire qui diceret, ‘ one seemed to corneto him, who
said! Cicero mentions no name. Livy says, ‘visus Jupiter venire?

121. Praesulem ludis, ‘the man who danced before the games? If
‘praesulem' is the true reading, the word is used in a very unusual sense.
⁵ Praesul ' is properly ‘ a president.’ literassy, ‘ one who sits above,’ from ⁸ prae'
and ‘ son? which is a variety of ‘sED,' the root of‘ sede0,’ the ‘D’ being
changed into ‘L‚' as in ‘ solium’ and ‘sella‚’ just as ‘ consul’ is properly ⁶ col-
1eague‚' literally, ‘ one who sits with another,’ and ‘ exsul‚’ literally‚ ⁵ one who
sits or lives away from home! If it is genuine here, it must be on a false
derivation from ‘ salio: ‘ to leap.’ Livy uses ‘ praesultatorem,’ and perhaps
the word here is ‘praesultorem.' ‘ Ludis ' is an ablative of time, being
equivalent to ‘ tempore ludorum? ¹

Iussum esse. The construction here suddenly changes to infinitives‚ de·
pendent on ‘ dicitur’ or ⁸ fertur’ to be supplied.

12 3. Suam is used here because it is the oratio obliqua of ‘ meam!

126. Debilem factum, ‘ was paralysed! Debilis is derived from ‘de’
and ⁶ habilis‚' and so is literally ‘ disabled,’ ‘ unhandy? Cp. the use of
‘habilis' in Virg. G. 4. 418

‘Atque habilis membris venit vigor.’

129. Iterum instauratos, ‘renewed once more.' Livy does not men-
tion the first ⁸ instauratio! ‚

132. Quaesturam petenti. According to the received story it was
