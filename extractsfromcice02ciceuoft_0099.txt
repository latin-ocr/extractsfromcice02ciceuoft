Sect. IV. ΒΕΑ UTIES OF NA TURE. 1 95

277. Illam, ⁴ which Ι have mentioned!

282. Subiecto corpori, ¹ forming the basis of the body.'

291. Humo excitatos. This contrast between man and the lower
animals is a favourite topic with the ancients. Cp. Ov. Met. 1. 85

‘Pronaque quum spectent animalia cetera terram,
Os homini sublime dedit, caelumque tueri
Iussit, et arrectos ad sidera tollere vultus.’

293. E terra. The preposition here belongs properly only to ⁴ spectatores·
in the second clause. Fully expressed it would be ‘non ut incolae atque
habitatores in terra, sed e terra spectatores!

296. Interpretes. ‘interpres’ is literally ‘a go between’ of any kind.
Here it is a synonym of ‘ nuntii τ’ ⁸ the conveyancers and messengers :'
rerum, ⁸ of all that happens!

321. Providit, i. e. ‘natura,' from above, though the two intermediate
verbs have different subjects.

3²3· Incideret. Here again this and the following imperfects subj. are de·
pendent on ‘munitae sunt,’ which is not in itself historicaL because the Latin
idiom refers the dependent verbs to the time when the action of the principal
verb was first contemplated by Nature 3 and so the force of the tenses is this :
‘ the eyelids are fortified with a kind of palisade of hair, which nature placed
there in order that,if anything werefalling into them, it might be repelled,' δίε.

3²4- ut iis. This, if it be the true reading, is a repetition of the preceding
‘quibus,' which: et iis.

325. Latent utiliter, ⁴ it is advantageous that they are sunk back.'

Excelsis, ⁴ prominent!

327. Superciliis is ablative not dative.

337. Adiectae voces, ⁶ the sounds which reach them.'

340. Relatus, ‘ echoed.' Cp. Virg. E. 6. 84

‘Ille canit: pulsae referunt ad sidera valles!

G. 4. 526
‘Ah miseram Eurydicen anima fugiente vocabatz
Eurydicen toto referebant flumine ripae.'

341. Resonatur, may either be used impersonally‚ or ‘sonus' may be
supplied to it from the previous sentence. A drawing of a lyre may be seen
in Dict. of Ant. v. Lyra, which has both the tortoise shell at the bottom‚
and a pair of horns projecting above between which the strings (fides) are
drawn. ⁸ Resonare' is used for ‘ to echo ’ in Virg. E. 1. 5

‘Formosam resonare doces Amaryllida silvas?
Cp. also G. 3. 338, and Hor. S. 1. 4. 76
‘Suave loeus voci resonat conclusus.‘

343. Propter necessarias utilitates, ‘ because their use is always
required.'

348. Ad incolumitatis custodiam, ‘to keep it unimpaired.' ⁴ In-
columis,’ like ‘calamitas‚’ is derived from ‘ cado,' by the common substitution
of d for l in Latin.
