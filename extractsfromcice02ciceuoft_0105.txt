ARGUMENT AGAINST PROVIDENCE.

This passage occurs among the arguments used against the existence of
a Providence, in reply to those from which the previous passage is taken. It
is inserted here as containing several interesting anecdotes. The difficulty
which it raises is, of course. no difficulty to a Christian.

1. Telamo. Cicero is quoting a line from some tragedy in which
Telamon is one of the characters. A play of Pacuvius called ‘ Teucer' is
osten quoted by Cicero, in which Telamon is one of the characters, and
from which this verse is probably taken. Cp. de Orat. 2. 46, Tusc. Disp.
5· 37-

Locum totum conficit, ⁸ sums up the whole argument.’ *Locus‚’ in
the sense in which it is used here, is a translation of the Greek τόπος. τόποι
in Aristotle are ‘ general heads of argument.’

Cur. The sense of ‘ cur' here is peculiar, for the verse which follows does
not give the reason why the gods pay no regard to men, but the grounds upon
which the writer believed it to be the case that' they did so disregard them. It
may be translated, ‘ the whole argument which proves that the gods pay no
regard to man.'

3. Cutem—sit. A bare supposition‚ like εἰ with opt. followed by an
opt. with ὄν in Greek. ‘ If they were to care for man, it would be well‚’ &c.
Qiod nunc abest, ⁶*which, as things are, is far from being the case?

8. Extulit, ⁴ buried.’ Maximus here means Q Fabius Maximus Cunc-
tator, the hero of the early part of the second Punic War. His loss of his
son is mentioned in Pt. 1. Sect. 1. xo, 3ο fon„ where Cicero records that he
spoke his funeral oration (laudatio).
