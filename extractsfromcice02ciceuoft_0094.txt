¹90 N o T E S. sect. ιν.

94. Habebam is here equivalent to ‘would otherwise have? literally.
⁴ they had‚’ i. e. before their trunk was added.

98. In araneolis aliae—aliae. He is here alluding to the two kinds
of spiders, those who sphi nets and those who spin webs. The former are
most frequently met with in the fields, and are called geometrical spiders,
the latter are usually found in dwellings. See an interesting description of
the two in Kirby and Spence’s Entomology, pp. 229 foll. 7th ed.

100. Ex inopinato, ‘in ambushl ‘out of sight 3’ literally, ‘from a place
from which they are not expected.' It more often means ‘unexpectedly.’
·‘ She does not station herself upon the surface of the net, but in the small
silken apartment constructed below it, and completely hidden from view·
But, thus removed to a distance from her net, and entirely out of sight of it,
how is she to know when her prey is entrapped? For this difficulty our
ingenious weaver has provided. She has taken care to spin several threads
from the edge of the net to that of her hole, which at once inform her by
their vibrations of the capture of a fly, and serve as a bridge on which in an
instant she can run to secure it) Kirby and Spence, p. 231.

101. Pinna. This tale of the ⁴ pinna' and the ⁴ squilla’ is told by
Aristotle, who calls the latter from it πιννοφύλαξ or πιννοτήρης. Cicero
elsewhere (De Fin. 3. Ι9) gives another reason for the alliance, that the
Squilla gives warning to the Pinna of the approach of enemies. But there is
no foundation for either story. See Hartwig's ‘ Sea and its Living Wonders‚'
p. 253. ‘ If many crabs are burdened with small animals and plants, others
live parasitically in the shells of mollusks. Thus the small “Pinnotheres
veterum ’⁹ claims the hospitality of the Pinna, a large bi-valve of the Medi·
terranean. The ancients supposed that this was a friendly connexion, an
“ entente cordiale” formed for mutual defence: that the Pinn‘a being destitute
of eyes, and thus exposed when he opened his shell to the attacks of the cuttle·
fish and other enemies, was warned of their approach by his little lodger‚
upon which he immediately closed his shell, and both were safe. Un-
fortunately there is not one word of truth in the whole story. The sole
reason for which the Pinnotheres takes up its abode under a stranger’s roof is
the softness of its own integuments‚ which otherwise would leave it utterly
defenceless; nor does the Pinna show the least sign of affection for its guest,
who on returning from an excursion often finds it very difficult to slip again
into the shell.'

106. Congressu ne—congregatae sint, ‘ whether it is by some mutual
agreement, or by nature and from the very first, they thus combine.’

108. Est etiam admiratio nonnulla in, &c., ‘ there is also something
to admire in.' ‘In' here means ‘in the case of.¹

111. Persequuntur, ‘make for!

113. Exclusi fotique, ‘hatched and reared? Cp. below l. 176, ‘Ex
quibus (ovis) pullos quum excluserint, ita tuentur ut et pennis foveant.’

118. Platalea‚ ⁸ the spoonbill.'

120. Mergerent. This and the other imperfecte. are to be translated
