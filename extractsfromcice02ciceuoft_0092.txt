158 N o T E S. sect. [ν.

26. Concretus in nubes cogitur, 'is condensed and thickened into ν

clouds! Cp. Virg. Ae. 5. 20
‘In nubem cogitur aer!

29. Spiritu ductus, ⁴ inhaled.’

32· Caeli complexus, ‘the encircling sky! ‘Complexus’ is a subst.
⁴ Determinatio,’ boundary.

34. Igneae formae, ‘ the fiery bodies: i. e. sun, moon, and stars, ὅτε.

Cursus ordinatos definiunt, ‘perform their appointed courses.'

E quibus sol, &a 1t1s not easy to realize exactly Cicero' s notion of
the mox ements of the heavenly bodies, but his meaning seems to be some-
thing of this sort: that the sun and moon revolved round the earth once in
twenty- -four hours' m the same sphere, but that their orbits were in entirely
different planes; hence the lunar phases and eclipses. The sun, however,
did not describe a perfect circle round the earth, but kept taking a wider
and wider range daily from mid-winter to mid—summer, and then a gradually
decreasing one: hence the phenomena of increasing and decreasing length of
day, and the changes of the seasons.

35. Multis partibus, ablative of measure. The sun is, in round nurn-
bers‚ one million and a quarter times as large as the earth.

36. Circum earn volvitur. That the sun and all the other heavenly
bodies moved round the earth was the popular belief of ancient times, and
was worked out by Claudius Ptolemaeus, who lived in Egypt in the second
century, Α. D. into a regular system, called from him the Ptolemaic. The
opposite or solar system, which makes the sun the centre of the universe,
was known to Pythagoras and taught by some of his disciples‚ but was never
extensively accepted till comparatively modern times, when it was firmly
established by Copernicus, Galileo, and lastly by Sir Isaac Newton. The story
of Galileo being condemned by the Pope tor teaching that the earth moved
round the sun, not the sun round the earth, is well known.

38. Binas in anno—facit, ‘twice in the year turns back from its
furthest point in opposite directions.’ He is referring to the summer and
winter solstices, when the sun, having reached its greatest declination north·
ward or southward, turns back towards the equator.

39. Contrahit, ‘ congeals‚' the ‘ quaedam ’ qualifying the boldness of the
metaphor. ‘ Contraho ' is used of the effect of cold, ‘ to pinch ’ or ‘ shrivel
up:' cp. Virg. G. 4. ²59

‘ Ignavaeque fame et contracto frigore pigrae.'

41. Maior quam dimidia pars terrae, ‘ more than halfas big as the
earth.' In reality, the earthjs about forty-nine times as big as the moon.

45. Subiecta atque opposita soli, literally‚ ⁶ coming immediately
under, and in the way of, the sun,’ i. e. ‘ passing in front of the sun’s disk‚
and so obstructing his rays in their passage to the earth.'

47. E regione solis, ‘on the opposite side (of the earth) to the sunl

48. Deficit, ⁴ is eclipsed.' Cp. Virg. G. 2. 478

‘Defectus solis varios, lunaeque labores!
