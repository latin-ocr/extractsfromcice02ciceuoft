NOTES.

1. 2. Bello Latinorum, ‘in the war with the Latius.’ Genitive of Object.

5. Iidem, ⁸ again ;' literally‚ ‘the same.' See note on ch. 2. 23.

6. Huius, ‘of our own times! Vatinius the grandson was one of the
most unscrupulous public men of the day. Cicero on one occasion made a
violent speech against him, which is still extant. He was one of Caesar’s
strongest supporters.

Praefectura. A ‘ praefectura’ was a municipal town, which, instead
of electing its own chief officers‚ who were in that case called ‘duumviri,’
a sort of imitation of the Roman consuls, had a governor appointed annually

at Rome, styled ‘ praefectus iuri dicundo?

9. Temere, ‘ indiscreetly,’ ‘ without authority.' De republica, ‘on
matters of state!

10. Qum idem dies constitisset, ‘when the days were found to
correspond;’ literally, ‘when the same day had concurred,’ i. e. in both
statements.

11. Vacatione‚ ⁶ exemption from military service.'

12. Locri, the people of Locri, in South Italy, on the south-east coast of
Brutii‚ called Epizephyrii (in the west), to distinguish it from the Locri in
Greece. This battle took place in the early times of the Greek colonies
in Italy. The date is uncertain, but it was somewhere in the last half of the
sixth century Β, c. The accounts of it are plainly unhistorieal‚ e. g. the
army of Crotona is said to have amounted to 130,000, and to have been
beaten by 10,000 Locrians.

14. Ludis Olympiae, ‘ at the Olympic games;' literally‚ ‘at the games
at Olympia.' Ludis is abl. of time, being equivalent to ‘ tempore ludorum:
and Olympiae is a locative case.

20. Ostenta—dicuntur. As Cicero’s argument is that the derivation of
these substantives from the verbs proves that the popular belief of his own
nation. as expressed in their language, agreed with his asserfion, it loses its
force if they are translated into another language. It is better to leave them in
their Latin form. Translate, ⁸ are called in Latin ‘⁶ ostenta,” “ monstra‚''‘ &c.

21. Prodigia. Cicero is right in connecting this word with ‘ praedicere:
though it is not directly formed from it. It is derived from ‘ pro.’ ‘ before:
and ‘ D10,' ‘ to point out,' the root frorn which ‘ dic-o,' ⁶ doc-eo,’ ‘ in-dic-are‚’
‘ dig-itus‚' and δείκ-νυμι in Greek, are all formed.
