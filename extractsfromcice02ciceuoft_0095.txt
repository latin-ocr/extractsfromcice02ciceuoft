Sect. [V. ΒΕΑ UTIES OF NA TURE. 191

in English by present tenses. The Latin idiom requires the verbs of a passage
quoted in ⁸ oratio obliqua· to be in imperfect subjunctive, even though they
do not refer to what is past, but to what happens constantly. Observe further
that though ⁴ legi' is strictly a perfect not an aorist‚ ‘1 have read,' not ‘1
read,’ yet it takes past tenses after it. This is often the case in Latin where
the dependent verb refers rather to the commencement or progress of the
action of the principal verb than to its completion. Thus, ‘ feci hoc ut in-
telligeres: ‘1 have done this that you may understand.¹ The full force of
the Latin is, ⁸1 have done this, and when l set about it, my object was that
you might understand.’ So here, ⁴ Ι have read an account and there it was
stated that there was a bird‚’ διε. See Zumpt. Lat. Gr. ξ, 514.

122. Invaderet‚ ‘seizes.' ‘invado' is often used of taking, generally
by force, what does not belong to one; cp. Cic. Phil. 1. r, ‘ qui in C.
Marii nomen invaserat: ‘who had usurped the name of C. Marius.’ Ib. 2. 16,
‘in multas pecunias alienissimorum hominum ejectis veris heredibus invasit.’

123. Conchis, ¹ with shell·fish.'

1 25. Rana marina‚‘the frog-fish,' also called the ⁸ angler' or‘fishing-frog ’
or ⁸ sea-devil.’ ⁴ On its head are two elongated bony appendages, curiously
articulated to the skull by a joint formed something like the links of a chain,
and capable of movement in any direction. The angler couches close to the
bottom of the sea, and by the movement of its pectoral fins stirs up the sand
and mud, and agitates the bony appendages amid the turbid cloud produced.
The small fishes observing the muddy water, and taking the filaments for
worms, approach to seize them, and are instantly engulphed in the capacious
jaws of the crafty Angler.' Wood’s NaturalHistory, p. 3 59. Couch, British
Fishes, vol. 2. p. 207, mentions an instance in which seventy—five hertings,
and another in which twenty-one flounders and a dory were found inside an
Angler, and in both cases the fish were of sufficient size‚ and sufficiently
uninjured to be sent to market.

126. Prope aquam, ‘just below the water.⁰

127. Ad quas=‘ et ad eas‚’ and therefore the verb is in infinitive‚ as
being coupled by the implied conjunction to ‘ moveri!

150. Illud, in English ‘this‚’ i. e. what follows, literally, ‘that other
matter: as contrasted with the one previously mentioned.

135. Tanquam a puppi, ‘ as a ship by a wind blowing aft.⁷ Cp. Virg.
Ae. 3. 130

‘Prosequitur surgens a puppi ventus euntes!

139. Ex iis qui acquierunt, ‘one of those which have had a rest.⁸
‘Aequierunt‚’ contracted perf. of ⁴ acquiesco.’

143. Q] id ea, supply ‘ censes’ or some such word, ⁸ What are we to think
of those things Τ

145. Alvos curant, ‘ keep themselves in health.' Cp. the phrase ² corpora
curare,' for ‘ taking meals.'

147. Caperentur. Another series of imperfects subj. after a principal
verb in the perfect, ‘ auditum est.¹ See above, note on l. 120.
