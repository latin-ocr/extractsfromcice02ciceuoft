434. Aquarum inductionibus, ⁸by irrigation,' which was, and still is
much practised in Italy on the slopes of the hills ; cp. Virg. G. 1. 106
⁸Deinde satis fluvium inducit rivosque sequentes;
Et curn exustus ager morientibus aestuat herbis,
Ecce! supercilio clivosi tramitis undam
Elicit, illa cadens rancum per levia murmur
Saxa ciet, scatebrisque arentia temperat arva.’

435. Arcemus, ⁴ confine within banks ς’ cf. above l. 249. Avertimus.
⁸ divert their channels.'

437. Qid vero? ‘nay more ς’ literally, ⁸but what (will you say of
this ?) '

438. Astrorum, ‘of the heavenly bodies: ‘astra' is here used as a ge-
neric terrn for sun, moon, and stars.

450. Talem effici potuisse, ‘ could have been made what they are.' -

451. Atque aliquando perorem comes in between ‘doceam’ and its
dependent clause, ⁸ omnia—parata,’ without affecting the construction. ‘ Ali-
quando' in such a position means ⁸ at last!

452. Qae sint. If the subjunctive is the correct reading here, it must
be explained as a sort of anacoluthon, Cicero having begun the sentence as
if he were going to end it with an impersonal verb, such as ⁸ dicendum est,’in
which case the relative clause would belong to the dependent infinitive, ot*
which ‘omnia’ would then be the subject, and so would be rightly in the
subjunctive. As the sentence stands, the relative clause belongs to the
principa] verb, and therefore would strictly be in the indicative, as in the
sentences immeditately preceding and following. There is, however, another
reading, ⁸ sunt.'

463. Ad mundi cohaerentiam pertinent, ⁸they assist in keeping
the universe together: the notion being that the revolutions of the heavenly
bodies,

⁸Cycle on epicycle, orb on orb,'

was as it were kept together.

464. Et spectaculum hominibus praebent, ⁸they also furnish an
object for men to gaze on with admiration ;' i. e. another object with which
they were created was to give pleasure to man, by offering a sight on which
his eyes might feast with delight.

465. Nulla est insatiabilior species, ‘there ιε no other sight which
never cloys (or, produces satiety), like this! A word like‘ insatiabilis‚’as
containing a negative, is, strictly speaking, incapable of degrees of corn·
parison.

Ad rationem sollertiamque praestantior, ‘so surpassing in refer-
ence to reason and contrivance,' i. e. ⁸ so conspicuous a proof of reason and
contrivancel employed' 1n the creation of the universe.

467. Dimetati 1s here used as a deponent participle, governing‘ ειπευεῖ
The more usual form is ‘dimensi,’ from⁸ dimetiorz’ the forms from‘ meto’
