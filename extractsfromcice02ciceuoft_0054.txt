150 N ο T E S. sect. 111.

31. salens-impressus, ‘ a furrow had been drawn deeper than usual.' ’
⁴ Imprimere ’ is properly applied to the plough, which makes the furrow by
the pressure on it. Hor. Od. 1. 16, 20

‘ imprimeretque muris
Hostile aratrum exercitus insolens.’

Exstitisse, ‘ to have emerged from the ground:

35. Cum admiratione, ‘in amazement!

38. Exceperint is subj. because it is in oratio obliqua.

39. Disciplina, ‘ system!

40. Rebus novis—referendis, ‘by the ascertaining of new facts, and
referring of them to the same principles!

41. Ab ipsis, i.e. from the Etruscan.

42. Haec scripta conservant, ‘these are preserved in written docu-
ments.’ There were said to be twelve ‘ books of Tages!

Hunc fontem—disciplinae, ‘these are the sources of the systems
of augury.’

44. Rarum est quoddam—avocent, ‘there is a class of men, few in
number, who withdraw themselves.’ The construction is, ‘ rarum est quod-
dam genus, (genus) eorum, qui‚' &c.

46. Horum sunt-humanae, ‘ their auguries come, not from divine
inspiration, but from human wisdom!

48. Aquarum fluxiones, ‘deluges.'

50. Tyrannidem, ‘usurpation.' The Greeks meant by τύραννος one
who gained his power by usurpation: the word had no reference with them
to the way in which the power was used, as it has with us. Several of their
τύραννοι were noted for their mild and beneficent sway.

53. Convinceret‚ ‘to refute.'

58. Defectionem solis. This eclipse is mentioned by Herodotus, 1. 74,
and he there adds that it had been predicted by Thales.

59. Gubernatores, ‘ pilots‚’ ‘ sailors.'

60. Nullam. Observe that it agrees in gender with divinationem,
though strictly it does not belong to it, but refers to some other word implied
from ⁸ praesentiunt! This is a not uncommon construction with factitive or
copulative verbs, and is like the construction of the relative with the same
class of verbs, e. g. below, ch. 6 ⁴ magi, quod genus sapientum et doctorum
habebatur.¹

64. Ex monte—avulsa est, ⁸ the end of Mount Taygetus was torn off
as the stern might be rent from a ship.' It is impossible to imitatein English
the brevity with which the image is here suggested by the one word quasi.

66. Potius divinus quam physicus, ‘aprophet so much as a natural
philosophen’

VI. 1. Phalaridis. Phalaris was tyrant of Agrigentum, and his name
was a proverb among the Greeks and Romans as a monster of cruelty. The
story of the brazen bull is well known, and shews what was the popular no-
tion of him, though it is probably itself unhistorical.
