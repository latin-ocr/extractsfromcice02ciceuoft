Greeks mapped out the stars into figures of men and animals, giving them
names by which they are still commonly known.

fable of the Belly and the Members, ‘ conspirasse inde (Membra) ne manus
ad os cibum ferrent, nec os acciperet datum, nec dentes conficerent!

79. Sollers subtilisque. ‘Sollers’ is derived from ‘ sollo,¹ an Oscan
word meaning ‘ whole,’ and ‘ ars,’ and so means literally ‘ clever at all things‚'
then generally, ‘ clever‚' ⁸ ingenious! ‘ Subtilis¹ is a contraction of ‘ subtextilis:
and means literally‚ ‘ woven fine,’ ⁸ fine spun‚' and thence generally applied
to anything that is minute, fine, precise, delicate, nearly=Gr. Muros.

masticate it!
