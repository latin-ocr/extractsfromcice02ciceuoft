from the sarne writer, Columella, to the same effect; ⁸ bovis tanta fuit apud
antiquos veneratio ut tarn capitale esset bovem necasse quam civem.’
505. Ferrea, &e. These lines are translated from Aratus. The original

lines are
Χαλκείη γενεὴ, προτέρων ὀλοώτεροι ἄνδρες
Οἳ πρῶτοι κακόεργον ἐχαλκεύσαντο μάχαιραν
Εἷνοδίην, πρῶτοι δὲ βοῶν ἐπάσαντ’ ἀροτήρων.
508. Visceribus, here used generally for ‘flesh.’ Cp. Virg. Ae. 6. 253
‘Et solida imponit taurorum viscera flammis)

512. Chrysippus. The saying of Chrysippus is given in Creuzer’s note
quoted from Porphyry‚ ἡ δὲ ὗς οὐ δι’ ἄλλό τι πλὴν θύεσθαι ἐγεγόνει, καὶ τῇ,
σαρκὶ τὴν ψυχὴν ὁ θεὸς οἷον ἅλας ἐνέμιξεν, εὐοψίαν ἡμῖν μηχανώμενος.

516. Pronoea, from Gr. πρόνοια, Providence personified. Athena was
worshiped at Delphi under the title οΐἈθηνᾶ Πρόνοια. Liddell and Scott
v. πρόνοια. By saying that ‘ Providence might be thought to be an Epi-
curean' Cicero means that she had provided so richly for mau's enjoyment
that one might think she accepted Epicurus’ principle that pleasure was the
‘ summurn bonum!

519. Alites et oscines, ⁸ those which give omens by their flight and those
which give thern by their Ποῖα] The two are expressed by Virg. Ae. 8. 360

‘qui sidera sentis
Et volucrum linguas et praepetis omina pennae,'
‘praepes' being the more usual word than ‘ ales.’

528. Spatia—camporum, ‘the wide extent of fruitsul plains.'

529. Tum—celeritate, ‘and moreover how we voyage over the sea
with incredible speed.'

530. Nec vero supra terram, ‘ and not only on the.surface of the earth is
this the case.' There is no verb which can be directly supplied from what has
gone before with these words, and ⁴ latet' which follows is of course in itself
inapplicable. Some general expressions must be supplied as suggested by the
whole context. The omission of ‘ rnodo' where the ‘ sed etiam’ in the
following clause of necessity suggests it is not uncommon. So in Greek οὐ
sometimes stands alone, without μόνον or ὅπως, before a following ἀλλὰ
καί, but chiefly in late Greek.

532. Utilitas. Here is another abstract substantive where we can hardly
use one in English. See above, note l. 4. Translate, ⁶ many usesul
things are hidden, which being created for man’s service, are by man alone
discovered? He uses ‘ invenitur’ rather than ‘ inventae sunt‚’ because dis-
coyeries were continually gomg on. The other would only refer to those
which had been already made.

536. Est enim profecto divinatio, ‘ for it is certain there is such athing
as divination.’ ‘ Divinatio’ was a generic term for all the different ways in
which the will of the gods was supposed to be conveyed to man.

537. Qum—publicis, ‘not only in regard to individuals, but much
more in regard to the state.'
