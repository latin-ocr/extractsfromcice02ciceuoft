Sect. lv, EA UTIES OF NA TURE. 1 93

Earum rerum quas terra gignit, ‘of the produce of the earth!

184. opportunitates, ‘ adaptations!

Ad cultum hominurn atque abundantiam. ¹ to enable man to till
the ground, and reap abundant crops.'

185. Aegyptum Nilus irrigat. 1t is only by the inundations of the
Nile and the deposits which it brings with it that any part of Egypt is made
capable of producing vegetation. The whole of the-Delta is formed ofalluvial
soil deposited by it, and the rest of the country owes its fertility entirely to
the yearly deposit of mud left by the river when it floods the country in
autumn. The manner of its cultivation is described by Hdt. 2. 14, who also
says, iu 2. 5 Αἴγυπτός ἐστι Αἰγυπτίοισι ἐπίκτητός τε Ὑῆ, καὶ δῶρον τοῦ
ποταμοῦ.

188. Euphrates. This river, flowing from the snow mountains of Armenia,
isin flood during the spring and early summer. It deposits a considerable
body of alluvial soil, and, like the Nile, has formed a Delta at its mouth.

189. Indus. On the subject of this assertion‚ 1 have been favoured with
the following interesting remarks by Dr. Mitchinson, the Head Master of the
King's School, Canterbury. He says, ⁴ Though it is not probable that the Indus
sows its own alluvial soil with grain, yet it is a certain fact that rivers do
transport the vegetable product of their upland valleys, and of the mountains
from which they spring, to the low—lying alluvial plains, which they in the
first instance create. As an example of this, 1 may mention that two summers
ago 1 found, quite in the low—lying valley of that tributary of the Aberdeen-
shire Dee which takes its rise out of the bosom of Ben-muic-dhui‚ an Alpine
plant¹ Arabis Petraea, which is frequent upon the summit and higher regions
of that mountain : it had evidently been transported by the river to a distance
of some ten miles, and, oddly enough, had adapted its mode of growth to
its new habitat, so much so as to seem to be almost a different plant
altogether.'

194. Fructuum, genitive, dependent on ⁴ fertiles ’ as implying ‘’plenty.’

200. Ventos Etesias, ‘monsoon5.' ἐτησίαι is the Greek name for the
north—westerly wind which blows in the Aegean for forty days during the dog-
days, but it was also given to other winds of the same character, e. g. to
the Egyptian monsoons, in Hdt. 2. 20.

205. Ab ora maritima remotissima,.i. e. so as to supply those who
would have difficulty in procuring supplies of sea-salt.

²09· Sic undique-concluditur, ‘thus from all points, and by every
kind of argument, we arrive at the conclusion!

213. Tantarum rerum molitio facta sit, ‘so vast a scheme of con·
trivance has been expended,’ lit. ‘the contriving of such great things has
been effected.’

228. Spiritu augetur, ⁸ draws in a larger amount of breath.’

230. Molitur, from ⁶ molo‚’ to ⁸ grind.’

Eorum—escas, ⁸ of these the front teeth aie sharp and cut up the food
as they bite it.’
