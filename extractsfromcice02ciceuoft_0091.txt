NOTES.

BEAUTIES OF NATURE.

1. Locata in media mundi sede. The ancients believed the earth
to be the centre of the universe, and that it alone was stationary while all
else moved around it. See Scipio’s Dream, ll. 80 and 124.

3. Frugibus, ‘erops.’ ‘ Fruges’ always refers to the produce of the
ground. and so is distinguished here from ‘arboribus.’ Cp. below, l. 433,
⁸ nos fruges serimus, nos arbores! For ‘fruit ' in our sense, meaning the
⁸ fruit of trees‚' the Romans sometimes used ‘ fructus 3 ' more often ‘ poma,'
sor the larger kind of fruit, ‘ baccae ’ for the smaller.

4. Fontium gelidas peremnitates, &c. Observe the fondness of the
Latin idiotn sor abstract substantives, which are often best rendered in
English by adjectives. So here ‘the cool ever-flowing spring5‚ the rivers
with their clear transparent streams, the banks clad with verdure‚' &c.

8. Reconditas‚ ‘ hid in its bosom!

11. Silvestrium‚ ‘ wild animals ; ’ opposed to ⁴ pecudum,’ which includes
all tame animals kept by man.

12. Cultores, ‘civilizers.’

13. Nqn patiuntur—vastari, ‘do not leave it either for fierce wild
beasts to make a wildemess of, or wild shrubs, with their tangled shoots‚ a
waste.’

15. Distincta, ‘dotted’ ‘Stinguo' is derived from ἐι-163 the same
root from which the Greek στίζω (στιγ·μα) comes, which meam, literally‚
· to mark with a pointed instrument! The simple verb is only used in old
Latin.

17. De divina ratione dubitaret, ‘would doubt the existence os a
Providence,' or, as it is expressed more fully by Cicero (de Nat. Deor. 1. 2)
· deorum mente atque ratione omnem mundum administrari et regi.’

18. Qae species universi, ‘how beautiful it is as a whole.’

22. Nativis‚ ⁸ natural.'

24· Finitimus, ‘which most nearly resembles!

Aer, aether. Observe the distinction between these two words: ‘ a‘er'
is the lower air, ‘ the atmosphere ; ’ ⁸ aether ’ the clear upper air, ‘the sky:

25. Fusus et extenuatus, ‘ expanded and rarefied!

Sublime fertur. Cp. Virg. E. 9. 29

‘Cantantes sublime ferent ad sidera cycni!
