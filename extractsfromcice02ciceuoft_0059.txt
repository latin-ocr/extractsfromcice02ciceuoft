SCIPIO’S DREAM.

Cicero, iu this extract. represents Scipio Africanus Minor narrating a
remarkable dream which he saw when in Africa.

1. M'. Manilio. Manilius was Consul in 149 Β. c. with L. Marcius Cen-
soriuus. The two Consuls were sent to Africa with an army to aid
Masinissa, and so commenced the third Punic War.

2. Tribunus rnilitum. This was the title of the chief officers of the
Legion. In Scipio's time six had become the established number to each
Legion. They did not command different divisions of the Legion‚ but
divided the command among them by rotation.

Nihil mihi potius fuit. ‘there was nothing 1 was so desirous of.’

3. Masinissam. Masinissa was king of Numidia, and had aided the
Romans against Carthagein the second Punic war. He had been of great
service to Scipio Africanus Major when he invaded Africa at the eud of the
war, and a great friendship had been established between them.

5. Senex. He was 89 years old. He died in the following year, and
Scipio divided his kingdom between his three sons.

9. Ita numquam-memoria, ‘ so constantly do 1 cherish in my mind the
recollection of that great and invincible her0.'

10. Illius, i. e. Scipio Africanus Major, the conqueror of Hannibal at the
battle of Zama.

12. Multis verbis ultro citroque habitis, ‘in much interchange of
conversations Ultro citroque, literally ⁶ backwards and forwards.'

14. Regio apparatu accepti, ‘entertained with royal state! Appara-
tus is specially applied to elaborate banquets: cp. Hor. Od. 1. 38, 1

‘ Persicos odi, puer, apparatus.¹
And so Cicero uses the verb ‘apparare’ in Verr. 2. 4, 20 ‘Licuit Calidio
posse domesticis copiis, quum magistratum aut aliquem superiorem invitasset,
ornare et apparare convivium!

Iu multam noctem, ⁶ till late at night! Similar phrases are, ‘ ad mul-
tam diem‚' ‘till late in the day ;’ ‘multa nocte‚' ‘late at night ;’ ‘multo
mane,' ‘ very early in the morning.'

18. Et de via—vigilassem, ⁴ both from my journey, and because 1 had
sat up so late! Qi here is causal, and so joined with a subj-

22. De Homero. He means that Ennius asserted that Homer appeared
ro him by night. Cicero alludes to this again, quoting Ennius' own words.
Acad. Prior. 2. 16 ⁴ Qum somniavit [Ennius], ita narravit,

Visus Homerus adesse poeta.’

De quo—loqui, ⁶ the reason being that he was constantly thinking and
speaking of him in his waking moments.’ Ennius is also recorded to have
expressed his fondness sor Homer in another way. Being a Pythagorean.
