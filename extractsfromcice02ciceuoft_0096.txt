150. Dictamnus‚ ‘dittany.’ There does not appear to be any sounda- ¹

tion for the story here told.

152. Seselis, ‘hart-wort.’

155. Sepiae, ⁸ the cuttle-fish.' ⁸ It might be supposed that the dibranchiate
cephalopods, by their swiftness‚ their arms, and their powerful jaws, were
sufficiently provided with means of attack or defence; but it must be
remembered that their body is soft and naked, and that, though well
armed in front, they may readily be attacked in the rear. To afford thern
the additional protection they required, nature, ever ready to minister to the
real wants of her children, has furnished them with an internal bag, corn·
municating with the respiratory tube, and secreting a large quantity of an
inky fluid, which they can squirt out with force in the face of their foe, and
which, mixing readily with the water, envelopes them in an opaque cloud,
and thus screens them from pursuit. But this inky fluid, thus useful to its ⁴
owner, is often the cause of its destruction by man, who applies it to his own
purposes; for the Italian pigment called “ sepia,’' so invaluable to painters in
water-colours, is prepared from the inspissated contents of the ink-bag of a
cuttle-fish.’ Hartwig, ⁸ The Sea and its Living Wonders,' p. 275.

156. Torpedines, ‘the electric ray,’ torpore, ‘by causing numbness,'
i. e. by electric shocks. ⁸ This fish possesses the power of accumulating in its
electrical organs a considerable amount of the electric fluid, much in the same
manner in which it is accumulated in the Leyden phial, so that while one of
its surfaces, the back, is in the positive condition, the belly is negative; and
the equilibrium could be restored by the interposition of water, metals, or
the human body.' Couch's History of British Fishes, vol. i. p. 125.

158. Esset, essent, continerentur. The imperfects again are depend-
ent on ⁴ adhibita est' which is a genuine perfect. See above, note on 1. 120.

Ut—deorum‚ ‘ great care moreover has been bestowed by Divine Provi-
dence to perpetuate everything with which the earth is furnishedl ‘Orna-
tus' is here used metaphorically‚ animals‚ plants, &c., being regarded as the
‘ furniture' (omatus) of the earth.

159. Essent‚here used absolutely, ‘should always exist,' ⁸ should never fail!

160. A terra stirpibus continerentur, ‘ are connected with the earth
by roots.’

161. Eam vim, ⁸ such abundance.'

167. Usque ad eum finem dum—defendere, ‘till such time as they
are able to take care of themselves.’

168. Etsi. The force of the conjunction is, ¹ not however that all
creatures do so, for fish,' &c.

173. Requirunt, ‘seek out?

175. Substernunt, ‘line them!

177. Se opponant, ‘ shelter thern from it: literally‚ ‘ put their own bodies
in the way of it?

180. Accedit, ‘is applied,’ literally‚ ‘is added,’ i. e. to what nature does
for them.
